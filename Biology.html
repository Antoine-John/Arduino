<h1>Topic 1:</h1>
<h1>Naming and classification of species</h1>
<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Taxonomy is the science of placing organisms into categories on the basis of their characteristics.</p>
<h2>Binomial nomenclature</h2>
<p>Binomial nomenclature is a system to name species. The first name identifies it's genus, the second name identifies the species. Here are some examples of binomial names : <ul> 
<li>Orchid : Cattleya mossiae</li>
<li>Salmonella : Salmonella enterica</li>
<li>Venus flytrap : Dionaea muscipla</li>
</p>
<h2>Cladistics</h2>

<h2>The five kingdoms</h2>
<p>There are five kingdoms that organisms are separated into:</p>

<h1>Bacteria</h1>
<p>Bacteria are single celled organisms with cell walls made from petidoglycan. They do not have a nucleus but instead, they contain a circular chromosome and several plasmids made of DNA. Plasmids are used to transfer genetic information from a bacteria cell to another during reproduction. <br> They can be decomposers that feed off other dead organisms and they can be pathogenic.<br> Examples include:<ul>
<li>Lactobacillus</li>
<li>Pneumococcus</li>
<li>E.Coli</li>
</ul>
 <img src="images/bacteria.PNG" height="300" width="500"/>
</p>
<p>The bacteria cell has a <b>FLAGELLA</b> which beats to move the bacteria. It contains <b>GLYCOGEN</b> grains which may be used as a food store. The slime coat is present in only some species of bacteria. It has a cell wall, a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and rybosomes.</p>
<br>

<h1>Protoctists</h1>
<p>Protoctists are single celled organisms. Some protoctists are similar to animal cells and some are similar to plant cells and contain chloroplasts.<br> They can be pathogenic.<br> Examples include:<ul>
<li>Amoeba</li>
<li>Plasmodium</li>
<li>Chlorella</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h1>Fungi</h1>
<p>Fungi can be multicellular or single celled. They are made up of a mycelium of hyphae. They have cell walls made from chitin. The hypha mabe septate hypha or aseptate hypha. They obtain nutrition by external secretion of digestive enzymes and absorbtion of the digestive products. This is called saprotrophic nutrition. <br> They can be pathogenic. They are decomposers<br> Examples include:<ul>
<li>Mushrooms</li>
<li>Yeast</li>
<li>Mucor</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h1>Plants</h1>
<p>Plants are multicellular organisms that produce their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Plant cells contain chloroplasts which is used during photosynthesis. Plants store their carbohydrate as starch within a single large vacuole in a cell.<br> All plant cells have a cell wall made from cellulose.<br> Examples include:<ul>
<li>Tulips</li>
<li>Venus flytraps</li>
<li>Orchids</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
There are four types of plants : Bryophytes, Pteridophytes (algae), Coniferophytes (ferns), Angiospermatophytes (angiosperms).</p>
<br><p>Bryophytes are seedless and do not have water conducting tissue. they lack xylem and phloem. Pteridophytes reproduce through cell division, have no roots and lack stems and leaves. Coniferophytes have roots, leaves, stems and vascular tissues. They create spores for wide dispersal and only live in shady humid areas. Angiosperms are divided into two groups : monocotyledons and dictoyledons. Angiosperms are flowering plants<br>
Monocotyledons have 1 cotyledon, a fiborous root system, long narrow leaves and parallel venation of leaves. Dicotolydons have 2 cotolydons, a tap root system, broad leaves and branched venation of leaves.</p>
<br>
<h1>Animalia</h1>
<p>Animals can be vertebrates or invertebrates. Vertebrates are animals with a backbone, whilst invertebrates are animals without a backbone, this may mean that they have a hard exoskeleton like arthropods, or do not contain any bones.<br>
</p>
<div id = "a">
<h2>Vertebrates</h2>
<h3>Amphibians</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Fish</h3>
<p>Fish are covered in scales that overlap to protect the fish from physical damage and to help streamlining for swimming. Fish have a lateral line usualy known as it's 'sixth sense'. The lateral line contains sense organs that help detect vibrations in water. It has fins for movement and stability in the water. some species also have a swim bladder. This helps fish stay at a certain altitude in the water without the need to constantly move every fin. It works by controlling the amount of air inside to change the fish's bouyancy. It has gills with many small cappilaries for gas exchange to tke place effectively.</p>
<h3>Reptiles</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Birds</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Mammals</h3>
<p></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Invertabrates</h2>
<h3>Nematods</h3>
<p>These are wormlike organisms that have unsegmented bodies. They have a sharp pointed mouth part and a mucus layer. They have long muscle tissue and move in a wiggling movement.</p>
<h3>Annelids</h3>
<p>Annelids such as the earth worm have long segmented body and chaetae. These are bristles found on each segment and is used for movement. It's long cylindrical body is covered in a mucus layer to help stop it from drying out.<br> Here are some examples: <ul>
<li>Bootlace worm</li>
<li>Leech</li>
<li>Eartworm</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Molluscs</h3>
<p>Molluscs have a hard shell protecting a soft body and has no limbs. The shell is used to prevent the mollusc from drying out. It's body has no segments and has eyes on tentacles. It also has two pairs of gills. It has a muscular foot with a slimy covering so that it can move by creeping over the surface. </p>
<h3>Arthropods</h3>
<p>All arthropods have a hard exoskeleton made from chitin, segemented bodies and jointed legs.</p>
<h4>Insects</h4>
<p>The body of an insect has three segments, the head, thorax and abdomen. It has 3 pairs of jointed legs, two antenae which are used to sense chemicals in the air and environment, a mouthpart which is specialized for each insect based on the type of feeding, compund eyes to detect food and avoid predators and in some, wings for flying.  </p>
<h4>Arachnids</h4>
<p>The body of an arachnid only has two segments: the head and thorax connected as one, and the abdomen. It has simple eyes, but more than a pair, which help to detect prey. It has powerful piercing jaws (all spiders are predators), four pairs of legs which allows for chasing of prey or holding onto web and a a spinneret, which produces long thin strands of silk for making webs.</p>
<h4>Crustaceans</h4>
<p>Crustaceans have five or more pairs of jointed legs which are flexible to help with feeding. they have gills to absorb O2 from H2O. In addition to the exoskeleton made from chitin that all arthropods have, crustacean have another thick shell made from caraspace. In some species the front legs  have been modified into pincers. </p>
<h4>Myriapods</h4>
<p>Myriapods have many segments. They usually have more than 10 segments each with pair of jointed legs. They have a hard exoskeleton with waterproofing. They have a pair of antenae and hard and sharp pincers.</p>
